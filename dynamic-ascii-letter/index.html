        Dear Sharon,
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to tell you how grateful I am for you. All those moments we've had together, I'll always cherish those.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have realized that I have not been been as vocal as I've liked in telling the people that I appreciate how much I appreciate itthem. That's why you got this lovely letter from me!
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking forward to some more crazy awesome times with you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Jonathan
