          Dear <span id="their-name">{THEIR NAME}</span>,
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to tell you how grateful I am for you. All those moments we've had together, I'll always cherish those.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have realized that I have not been been as vocal as I've liked in telling the people that I appreciate how much I appreciate itthem. That's why you got this lovely letter from me!
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to some more crazy awesome times with you!
